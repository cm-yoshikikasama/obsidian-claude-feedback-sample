# English Lesson Feedback Generator

## Your task

1. Check and transcribe audio files from input directory
2. Read the latest transcript file
3. Load previous feedback for comparison
4. Generate detailed feedback and save to 03_eng_study folder

### Step 1: Check Audio Files and Transcribe

```bash
ls .claude/audio_video_to_text/input/
cd .claude/audio_video_to_text && uv run audio_video_to_text.py
```

### Step 2: Read Latest Transcript

```bash
ls -la .claude/audio_video_to_text/output/
```

Find and read the latest `*_transcript.txt` file from output directory.

### Step 3: Load Previous Feedback

- **IMPORTANT**: Current directory is `.claude/`, so you MUST search from parent directory
- Use bash command: `find ../04_EngStudy -name "*-feedback.md" -type f | sort -r | head -1` to find latest feedback
- Alternative: Use Glob with `Glob(path="..", pattern="04_EngStudy/**/*-feedback.md")`
- Read the latest feedback file (format: `yyyy-mm-dd-feedback.md`)

### Step 4: Generate Feedback

Analyze the lesson transcript and generate detailed feedback. Save to `03_eng_study/$ARGUMENTS-feedback.md`.

**Important: Read transcript and previous feedback before analysis.**
